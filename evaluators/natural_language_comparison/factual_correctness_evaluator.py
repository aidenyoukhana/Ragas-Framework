"""
Factual Correctness Evaluator

Compares and evaluates the factual accuracy of the generated response with a reference.
Uses claim decomposition and natural language inference to measure factual overlap.

Formula:
    F1 = 2 × (Precision × Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
    Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
    Recall = TP / (TP + FN)

Where:
    TP = Claims in response that are in reference
    FP = Claims in response that are NOT in reference
    FN = Claims in reference that are NOT in response

Modes: 'F1' (default), 'precision', 'recall'
