            Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
            Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has become one of the most popular
            programming languages in the world. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use
            of significant indentation. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured,
            object-oriented, and functional programming. The language provides constructs that enable clear
            programming on both small and large scales. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic
            memory management. It has a large and comprehensive standard library, often described as having
            batteries included. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, making Python
            a truly cross-platform language. The language is used in various domains including web development,
            data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. Popular frameworks
            like Django and Flask have made Python a preferred choice for web development. In data science,
            libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib provide powerful tools for data analysis and
            visualization. Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have further cemented
            Python's position in the AI and ML community.
